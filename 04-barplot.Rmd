# create dummy categorical data

  # for categorical graphs its often useful to make the category a factor. This lets
  # you control the order by which it appears on the plot. Below we use fct_reorder
  # from the forcats package to reorder the fruit variable by the quantity of fruit.
  mutate(fruit = forcats::fct_reorder(fruit, quantity))



# barchart

# ggplot is the first command for any ggplot2 plot. data and aestetics aes()
# can be defined here or in any individual geom_*(function) 
ggplot(data = categorical_data, aes(x = fruit, y = quantity)) +
  
  # geom_bar takes a quantity from a "tidy" dataset, here we just have one
  # category-value pair so we use geom_col instead
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  
  # themes change the overall look of the plot. these can also be modified
  # further if need be (also can use packaged themes like theme_economist)

  # with lots of values. Omit to make normal bar chart
